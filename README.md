# Asset-Allocation
Asset Allocation implementation in Python

## Introduction 

The idea here is to encapsulate Asset Allocation logic into a separate component and make it available to other projects (GnuCash Portfolio, and Android apps).

This will include its own data storage.

Dependencies will include:
- price database, for calculation of current value
- transaction database for securities, for calculation of current value
